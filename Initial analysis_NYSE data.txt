In this project, I analyzed real life Kaggle's New York Stock Exchange S&P 500 dataset.
I have used only a subset of the large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. 

This data is provided by Udacity and is cleaned already.
I have just changed the column names to not include spaces for better readability.


First thing, View-> freeze panes -> freeze top row, so I know which column value I am looking at.

The company with the maximum total revenue in any individual year .

Then I renamed the cell ranges in the whole column such as Total_revenue into a named range called 'Total_revenue' same as the column name. I repeated the same for other columns like  Cost_of_Goods_Sold , Sales_General_and_Admin, Research_and_Development,  Other_Operating_Items, Ticker_symbol  and created named ranges for the all these respectively.

I also renamed the whole sheet as a named range 'NYSE_data'.

Exploring data and summary statistics
-----------------------------------

The company with  the maximum total revenue in any individual year

fomula - max(total_revenue)
The company with this maximum revenue -formula  =INDEX(Ticker_Symbol,MATCH(MAX(Total_Revenue),Total_Revenue,0))

This returns WMT company.

Confirmed by searching for the maximum total revenue and confirmed that yes, WMT company returned the maximum total revenue in the year 2015.

------------------------------
Mean of total revenue per year
--------------------------

To calculate this, I made a pivot table with the 2 columns period_ending and total_revenue.
